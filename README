Hello and Welcome to Are you smarter than a 5th grader I mean, how good is GPT?

This year for AOC, I will be running the Advent of Code puzzles through GPT, racing
a human to see which of us can complete the puzzle first. So far:

__ Day 1 (completed 12/6/22)
__ Day 2 (completed 12/6/22)
__ Day 3
__ Day 4
__ Day 5
__ Day 6 Beat the human by a few minutes
__ Day 7
...

My Predictions as 12/6/22 for ChatGPT:

- ChatGPT easily blows through the next few puzzles then starts having trouble with
  more complex items
- @Derrick beats ChatGPT within the next week
- ChatGPT crashes at midnight eastern time due to high traffic on OpenAI
