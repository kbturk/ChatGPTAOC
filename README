<h2>
Hello and Welcome to <strike>`Are you smarter than a 5th grader`</strike> I mean, how good is GPT?</h2>

<hr>

<p>
This year for AOC, I will be running the Advent of Code puzzles through GPT, racing
a human to see which of us can complete the puzzle first. So far:

_ _   Day 1
_ _   Day 2
_ _   Day 3
_ _   Day 4
☑️☑️ Day 5
☑️☑️ Day 6 Beat the human by a few minutes
_ _   Day 7

<h3>My Predictions as 12/6/22 for ChatGPT:</h3>

- ChatGPT easily blows through the next few puzzles then starts having trouble with
  more complex items
- @derrickturk beats ChatGPT within the next week
- ChatGPT crashes at midnight eastern time due to high traffic on OpenAI</p>
