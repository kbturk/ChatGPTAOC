Day 1 Prompt - 12/6/22
---
"please write me a python program to solve the following problem: <copy paste Day1 starting with 'The jungle...>"
---
after verifying part one, copy and pasted part 2.
---
Day 1 and 2 would not work together in a py file because the input file was consumed by part 1, making part 2 error out. I pasted the out of range error I got, it updated part 2 to return 0 if len(calories) < 3.
---
"write me a single python program that will solve both problems described"
program returned a working python solution, but the user must provide either a 1 or 2 signifying the part of the program.
