Day 4 Prompt:
---
"please write a python program to solve the following problem:"<Day 4 prompt>
the first program I recieved did not include a split for ',' so it failed on the input.
ChatGPT confidently said it would process the input and produce the right answer.
---
"that program gave me the following error: <python terminal error>"
The program now parses the input but the counter loop is not correct.
---
"That is incorrect. That program produces a count of 29 instead of 2"
I got the same program back.
---
"the range() function on both range(len(ranges)) should to increment by 2"
that loop is still wrong.
---
"there should only be one loop function for 'count' comparing i with i+i and incrementing by 2 each time"
the program now works
---
Part 2:
"please write a python program to solve the following problem:"<Day 4 prompt part 2>
I got a similar program to part 1 but it made the same mistakes it did the first time around on the range function.
---
"there should only be one loop function for 'overlaps' comparing i with i+i and incrementing by 2 each time"
after this I went back and forth with it awhile trying to get it to correct the overlap range loop. It's pretty off track at this point.
---
restarting part 2:"please write a python program to solve the following problem: <Day 4 prompt part 2 with part 1 taken out>Pairs of ranges are important here: for the totals, please create a single iterator that increase by 2 each pass"
it got the loop right but it failed to parse the string right.
---
update solution to also remove newline characters from the input_string
---
Please fix the following error: line 16, in main
    pair2 = pairs[i + 1]
IndexError: list index out of range
---
the pairs line generation is not right. I need pairs to look like the following given the example input: input = '2-4,6-8\n2-3,4-5\n'... becomes: pairs = [(2,4),(6,8),(2,3),(4,5)...]
---
it gave me a pairs line that doesn't parse the input the way it says it does, so I respond with:
bro it don't
chatGPT doesn't understand that.
---
that formula for pairs does not correctly generate the list of pairs from the input string. That formula does not handle '\n'
chatGPT crashes.
