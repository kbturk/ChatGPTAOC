## Hello and Welcome to ~~Are you smarter than a 5th grader~~ I mean, Are you smarter than ChatGPT?


This year for AOC, I will be running the Advent of Code puzzles through ChatGPT, racing
a human to see who can ~~complete the puzzle first~~ complete the daily puzzle. So far:  
      Puzzle Completed:  
Day 1 ✅✅  
Day 2 ✅✅ ChatGPT had a lot of problems solving this puzzle  
Day 3 ✅✅ Easy street!  
Day 4 ✅  
Day 5 ✅✅  
Day 6 ✅✅ Beat the human by a few minutes  
Day 7 ❌❌ Totally face planted. This was a human-solve day.  
Day 8 ❌❌ It did better than yesterday but it would go down a path I couldn't get it out of after several restarts so...  


### My Predictions as 12/6/22 for ChatGPT:

- ChatGPT easily blows through the next few puzzles then starts having trouble with more complex items ✅
- derrickturk[https://github.com/derrickturk/advent-of-code] beats ChatGPT within the next week ✅
- ChatGPT crashes at midnight eastern time due to high traffic on OpenAI ✅

Update: all of these happened on 12/7! However, ChatGPT didn't stay down for long but it never could complete the Day 7 puzzle.
