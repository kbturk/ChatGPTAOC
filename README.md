## Hello and Welcome to ~~Are you smarter than a 5th grader~~ I mean, how good is GPT?


This year for AOC, I will be running the Advent of Code puzzles through GPT, racing
a human to see who can complete the puzzle first. This race began on Day 6. So far:  
      Puzzle Completed:  
Day 1 ☑️☑️  
Day 2 ☑️☑️ ChatGPT had a lot of problems solving this puzzle  
Day 3 ☑️☑️ Easy street!  
Day 4  
Day 5 ☑️☑️  
Day 6 ☑️☑️ Beat the human by a few minutes  
Day 7  


### My Predictions as 12/6/22 for ChatGPT:

- ChatGPT easily blows through the next few puzzles then starts having trouble with more complex items
- derrickturk[https://github.com/derrickturk/advent-of-code] beats ChatGPT within the next week
- ChatGPT crashes at midnight eastern time due to high traffic on OpenAI
